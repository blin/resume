applications that work with Zabbix monitoring system.

#. I've been responsible for migration from Nagios to Zabbix
#. I've initiated and carried out migration of all monitoring scripts from
   bash/awk/perl/php/ruby to python
#. I've initiated migration of monitoring web applications to python,
   and new ones are since written in python
#. I've written alternative implementation of Zabbix agent in python
   and replaced Zabbix agent in production with it (see Zabby below)
